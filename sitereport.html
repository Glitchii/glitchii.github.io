            <h2>Introduction</h2>
            <p>
                Unlike probably most of my classmates, I've had prior experience (about 2 years) in web development, therefore,
                I have a good grasp of the basics.
                <!-- Because of this headstart, I did not get to learn much during this module,
                but have I plessure helping others. -->
                <!-- For this assigment, we were assigned to create a website that consists of a
                few pages which are: the home page (index), a contact page, blog, portfolio, and sitereport. -->
            </p>

            <h3>Files & file structure</h3>

            <p>
                There are 6 HTML files in this assignment project. All HTML files are in the root directory of the project.
                I made seperate folders for other files, such as js directory for JavaScript files, CSS for CSS files, imgs for images etc.
                All the above folders are in the assets directory.
                The index.html file is homepage. Most pages are linked in the header including the contact page and home page &
                some pages won't be displayed based on the active page. Since this is actually my personal website, I decided
                not to include all pages eg. sitereports or blog in the the menu since they will be useless to most people coming
                to view my website.
                <br>
                <br>
                While every HTML file has its own CSS and (if used) JS files, I also have global files such as index.css and index.js.
                These files content required and used for all pages. index.css is imported in all CSS files with CSS's `@import` rule.
                You can find this line on the first line of all CSS files except the index.css and 404.css. index.js is imported through all HTML files.
                index.css has styles for content like the header which is on all pages and index.js has things like event listeners (etc) for the header and other global elements.

                <p>
                    The blog page is a page where I display my school projects. I chose to use this page only for my school projects,
                    as I had already chosen to display all my presonal projects on the homepage, see the part for the homepage for the reason why.
                    My personal projects can also be found in the menu.

                <p>
                    Before designing the blog page (or any page infact), I had to make sure that I had a clear idea of what I wanted to achieve.
                    First step was to note down what I needed on the page, and the kind of design I wanted.
                    Sometimes I already have a design idea in my head already, when I don't, I normally looked design inspiration from a search
                    engine or images on websites like <a href="https://dribbble.com" class="lnk">Dribbble</a> or <a href="https://www.behance.net" class="lnk">Behance</a>.
                    I got inspiration for the blob page from <a class="lnk" target="_blank" href="https://cdn.dribbble.com/users/33073/screenshots/15238065/media/5df5a84f3ed908ad7bad36fa645e3d4a.png">this image</a>
