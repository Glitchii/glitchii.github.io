        <h1>Site Report</h1>
        <section class="intro">
            <h2>Introduction</h2>
            <p>
                Unlike probably most of my classmates, I've had prior experience (about 2 years) in web development, therefore,
                I have a good grasp of the basics.
                <!-- Because of this headstart, I did not get to learn much during this module,
                but have I plessure helping others. -->
                <!-- For this assigment, we were assigned to create a website that consists of a
                few pages which are: the home page (index), a contact page, blog, portfolio, and sitereport. -->
            </p>

            <h3>Files & file structure</h3>

            <p>
                There are 6 HTML files in this assignment project. All HTML files are in the root directory of the project.
                I made seperate folders for other files, such as js directory for JavaScript files, CSS for CSS files, imgs for images etc.
                All non-HTML files/folders are in the assets directory.
                The index.html holds HTML code for the homepage. Most pages are linked in the header including the contact page and home page &
                some pages won't be displayed based on the active page. Since this is actually my personal website, I decided
                not to include some pages eg. sitereport, blog, & portofolio in the the menu since they will be useless to most people coming
                to view my website.
                <br>
                <br>
                While every HTML file has its own CSS and (if used) JS files, I also have global files such as index.css and index.js.
                The code in these files are used by all pages. index.css is imported in all CSS files with CSS's `@import` rule.
                You can find this line on the first line of all CSS files except the index.css (itself). index.js is imported through all HTML files.
                index.css has styles for content like the header (which is the same HTML code in all HTML fiels except a few changes in links) which is on all pages and index.js has code like event listeners (etc) for the header and other global elements.
            </p>
        </section>
        
        <section class="pages">
            <h2>Pages</h2>
            <details class="page" data-path="/blog">
                <summary>Blog page <a href="/" target="_blank"></a></summary>
                
                <div class="date">

                </div>

                <p>
                    The blog page is a page with a list of posts. Each post has a title, a short description, a date and an image.
                    <br>
                    I used grid for the columns. On a typical 1920x1080 screen, the blog page would have 3 columns of posts. On smaller screens,
                    the blog page would have 2 columns or one depending on what fits.
                </p>

                <p>
                    Before designing the blog page (or any page infact), I had to make sure that I had a clear idea of what I wanted to achieve.
                    First step was to note down what I needed on the page, and the kind of design I wanted.
                    Sometimes, I already have a design idea in mind already, but when I don't, I normally look for design inspiration from a search
                    engine or images on websites like <a href="https://dribbble.com" class="lnk">Dribbble</a> or <a href="https://www.behance.net" class="lnk">Behance</a>.
                    For the blog page, I got inspiration from <a class="lnk" target="_blank" href="https://cdn.dribbble.com/users/33073/screenshots/15238065/media/5df5a84f3ed908ad7bad36fa645e3d4a.png">this image</a>

                </div>

                <p>
                    Before this assisgnment, I already had a personal website (hence the early date above) which already matched most of the requirements,
                    with just a few things to add or change. Plus, it was already on GitHub pages. I decided to use this as the website for my assignment.
                    Because this page is what people will see first, I chose it to showcase all my personal projects and my introduction.
                </p>

                <h3>Why academic projects are excluded from homepage & menu</h3>
                
                <p>
                    I chose to exclude my academic projects on the homepage and from the 'projects' tab in the header because
                    they would not be very interesting compared to my personal projects and they do not represent my skills as much as personal projects would.
                </p>
                
                <h3>Design choices</h3>
                
                <details class="preview" open>
                    <summary>Homepage screenshot</summary>

                </details>
                
                <p>
                    The design this time had no inspiration. I chose a simple but beutiful design for the homepage.
                    On the top right I chose to have my introduction and projects on the button and in the header
                    as well since the header will be the same on others pages but not all of them show projects except the homepage.
                </p>

                <h3>Theme switching & useful information</h3>

                <p>
                    Pressing the <span class="inline-icon i"></span> icon in the top right of the website, reveals buttons to switch
                    themes in the bottom right and useful information like when the website was last updated in the bottom right.
                    The date when the website was last updated is not added in manually, instead is retrieved through a get request
                    to GitHubs API on the repo <a target="_blank" href="https://api.github.com/repos/Glitchii/glitchii.github.io" class="lnk">https://api.github.com/repos/Glitchii/glitchii.github.io</a> to get the date of the
                    last commit in the repository. When a theme is selected, a value is stored in the local storage of the browser
                    which is loaded when the website is accessed again to use the user's prefered theme. 
                </p>

                <p>
                    The portfolio page is a page where I display my school projects. I chose to use this page only for my school projects,
                    as I had already chosen to display all my presonal projects on the homepage, see the part for the homepage for the reason why.
                    My personal projects can also be found in the menu.

                <p>
                    The contact page contains a form where a user can optionally input their name, email and a mandantory message. Once submitted,
                    the message is sent to my email address using the mailto protocol. Since the website is not dynamically served by myself (but instead by GitHub Pages),
                    I do not have control over the server and thus cannot receive the form from the backend.

                    If you click 'contact' in the header of the <b>homepage</b>, instead of redirecting to a new tab, the contact page will load in the same tab.
                    <br>
                    Although, a seperate contact page also exists if you middle click on the 'contact' button instead of left clicking, or go to /contact directly.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    Just like others pages, the contact page also includes the header and has the same colour scheme as other pages.

                <p>
                    Lastly, I created a site report page which contains a summary of the whole website and its pages.<br>
                    This page contains the design choices, information about the website and pages, & dates when each page was added, etc.<br>
                    Version control & GitHub were big players in the writting of this report as I could check GitHub to see when a page was added to show here.
                </p>
                
                <h3>Design choices</h3>
                
                <p>
                    There probably is no reason to include a screenshot of this page, since you are already looking at, but if still required—
                </p>

                <details class="preview">
                    <summary>here it is</summary>
                    <img src="/assets/imgs/reports/sitereport.png" alt="Blog page image">
                </details>
                
                <p>
                    As you have noticed already, I have used a lot of detail tags, to allow opening and closing sections of the report.
                    This makes it easy to focus on one thing since there is a lot of text on this page. Plus, it looks nicer. Some images are also closed by defeault because they huge.
                </p>

                <h3>Summary</h3>
                
                <p>
                    Due to my head-start in in web development, I have had less of a bad experience working completing the assignment. <br>
                    While JavaScript is not included in the assignment brief, I used it to make the website dynamic. <br>
                    I used JavaScript in in many parts of the website to:
                </p>

                <ul>
                    <li>Removing the loading screen on the homepage.</li>
                    <li>Dynamically add projects to the projects list from an object t avoid repeating and updating multiple HTML files when I add a new project.</li>
                    <li>Toggle the 'projects' menu in the header.</li>
                    <li>Toggle the harmburger menu.</li>
                    <li>Toggle & animate the 'contact' section in the homepage when 'contact' is clicked.</li>
                    <li>Display the current URL in the 404 page</li>
                    <li>Display the URL alongside the domain in the main detail tags on the sitereport page</li>
                    <li>Alter the message to add author and email (if provided) at the end on an email when submited in the contact form</li>
                </ul>

                <p>
                    The 404 page is also not required, but I have included it to have my own 404 page show when the user goes to a page that does not exists
                    rather than showing GitHub Pages's default 404 page.
                    <br>
                </p>

                <h4>Responsiveness</h4>
                
                <p>
                    As also required, I made sure to make every single page of the website responsive. This means that the website will work on any device, from a smartphone to a desktop and most browser, either Chromium or Gecko based.
                    Probably the only exception to browsers is Internet Explorer as is a very old and unsuppoted browser, and I have not been able to test it on my computer. Although, I do not expect anyone exessing this site to be using it.

                <p>
                    I used <a href="https://validator.w3.org/" class="lnk" target="_blank">W3C validator</a> to check that all pages were correctly and semantically structured were necessary and designed based on <a href="https://html.spec.whatwg.org/multipage/" target="_blank" class="lnk">W3C/WHATWG HTML standards</a>. All pages were marked as valid as in the screenshots below.
